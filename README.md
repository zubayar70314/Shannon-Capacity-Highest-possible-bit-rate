# Shannon-Capacity-Highest-possible-bit-rate
Shannon Capacity/ Highest possible bit rate: Input: Bandwidth (an integer) of channel in Hz, Number of signal components (N), Signal power for all the signal components in mWatt, Noise Power for all the signal components in mWatt Output: Shannon Capacity/ Highest possible bit rate  [Hint: SNR = (Summation of signal powers for all components/ Summation of noise powers for all components)]
